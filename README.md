# AI Models Compilation

This repository contains a curated compilation of machine learning and AI models developed as part of both individual explorations and group projects. The collection showcases work in applied machine learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation using Jupyter notebooks.

> **Note:** Some models are still in progress or bound by academic confidentiality rules. Details below.

## Contents

### `ads.ipynb` ‚Äî *Ad Click Prediction (Work in Progress)*  
A model initially designed for predicting user ad-click behavior.  
- **Status:** Incomplete due to lack of sufficient and clean dataset.

### `heartlogis.ipynb` ‚Äî *Heart Disease Classification using Logistic Regression*  
A binary classification model that detects the likelihood of heart disease based on patient features.  
- **Status:** Functional and tested.
- **Model:** `LogisticRegression()` from Scikit-learn.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Explanation:
While training the model, the following convergence warning is encountered:


**Explanation:**  
This warning indicates that the logistic regression solver (`lbfgs`) did not reach optimal convergence within the default number of iterations. This is a common issue and does **not** necessarily indicate a model failure. It can be addressed by:
- Increasing the `max_iter` parameter.
- Scaling the dataset using techniques such as StandardScaler.
- Trying alternative solvers like `saga` or `liblinear` depending on the dataset size and sparsity.

Despite the warning, the model is still functional and produces meaningful results.

### `cry_detection` ‚Äî *Infant Cry Classification (Thesis Project)*  
A deep learning model developed to classify various types of infant cries (e.g., hungry, pain, discomfort).  
- **Status:** Complete, with real-time data support and audio input preprocessing.
- **Note:** Due to university academic integrity policies, the core implementation notebook (`cry_classification.ipynb`) is **not included** in this repository.  

This project reflects significant collaborative effort and was the centerpiece of our undergraduate thesis.
